# Numbers

This is a little novice test program I made as I start teaching myself Java.
Basically it just generates an array of 10 random numbers, then searches the array for two adjacent numbers that have
the largest product. It then tells you the numbers stored in the array, which two numbers met these conditions, and what their product is. Weeeeee it works!
